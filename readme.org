These are my solutions to [[https://adventofcode.com/2020][Advent of Code 2020]] in ClojureScript to be
executed via [[https://github.com/planck-repl/planck][Planck REPL]].

That's my first excursion to Planck and even to ClojureScript, so it's
kind of an experiment to see how this is going. So far I'm quite happy
though. If Clojure is about getting rid of unnecessary fluff like
Classes, then Planck is about getting rid of even more which isn't
required for the kind of short Programs AOC requires. That is: no
=project.clj=, not compile step, no elaborate namespaces, etc.
